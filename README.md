âš™ WBS Project 6 Supervised Machine Learning to predict house prices in the USA

ðŸ”¹ WBS Project 6 Supervised Machine Learning Models to predict House prices in the USA

ðŸ”¸ Project Intro/Objective

Collection of different machine-learning techniques applied to a dataset with the objective to predict house prices.
The purpose of this project is to apply supervised machine learning models to real-life data.
Data had to be explored, preprocessed and then used for model training and evaluation.

ðŸ”¹ Methods Used
  * Linear Regression
  * Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  * Random Forest Regression
  * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  * Data Visualization
  * Gridsearch for tuning

ðŸ”¹ Technologies
  * Python
    * Pandas
    * Jupyter Notebook
    * Requests (api)
    * Matplotlib
  * Scikit Learn
   
ðŸ”¸ Project Description

ðŸ”¸ The data used is available in Kaggle:

Housing Data link >> [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).

ðŸ”¸ Main goals of the project:

* Train and apply different ML models to get the best performance when predicting the price of houses based on the provided features.
* Tune the models to minimize RMSE.

The notebook describes the application of different ML techniques, saving the results in a dataframe, and comparing the models performance.
