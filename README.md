# WBS-Project-7-Supervised-ML---Predicting-house-prices

Project Intro/Objective
Collection of different machine-learning techniques applied to a dataset with the objective to predict house prices.
The purpose of this project is to learn applying supervised machine-learning to real-life data.
Data had to be explored, preprocessed and then used for model training and evaluation.

# Methods Used
Linear Regression
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Random Forest Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Data Visualization
Gridsearch for tuning
Technologies
Python
pandas, jupyter, sklearn, seaborn
Supervised and unsupervised machine-learning techniques from sklearn package

Project Description

## The data used is available in Kaggle:

Housing Data link >> [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).

Main goals of the project:

Train and apply different ML models to get the best performance when predicting the price of houses based on the provided features.
Tune the models to minimize RMSE.

The notebook describes the application of different ML techniques, saving the results to a dataframe, and comparing performance.
